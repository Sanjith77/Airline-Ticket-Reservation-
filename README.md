# Airline-Ticket-Reservation-


Overview:
This Airline Ticket Reservation system project refers to a software application or online platform that allows individuals to manage their reservations, and complete payments for air travel.It typically offers functionality for both passengers and airline staff to manage the ticket process efficiently. Here's a general description of how it works:

Flight Search:
Passengers can search for available flights based on their travel preferences such as departure city, destination, travel dates, and class of service (e.g., Economy, Business, First Class).
Results usually include details like flight duration, layovers, ticket prices, and available seating options.


Booking and Reservation:
Once a flight is selected, the system enables users to enter personal information (name, contact details, passport, etc.) and choose additional services (meals, extra baggage, etc.).
Customers are given an option to reserve seats based on their preference (window/aisle) and even upgrade their class if needed.

Reservation Management:
Passengers can view, modify, or cancel their reservations through the system, typically subject to airline policies on changes and cancellations.
Rebooking flights, checking the status of flights, and adding extras like lounge access or insurance can also be done through the system.


Customer Support:
Integrated customer support for handling inquiries or issues related to booking, cancellations, refunds, or flight changes.

Efficiency: Reduces the need for manual processing and speeds up the reservation process.
Cost-saving: Many systems offer promotions and allow passengers to compare prices across multiple airlines.
Real-time Availability: Offers updated information about flight availability, seat selection, and fare changes.
